## C++ - Standard Template Library (STL)

The **Standard Template Library (STL)** is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks. 

### Key Components of STL

1. **Containers**: These are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind. The STL provides several container classes such as:
    - **Sequence Containers**: `vector`, `deque`, `list`, `array`, `forward_list`
    - **Associative Containers**: `set`, `multiset`, `map`, `multimap`
    - **Unordered Associative Containers**: `unordered_set`, `unordered_multiset`, `unordered_map`, `unordered_multimap`
    - **Container Adaptors**: `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`

2. **Algorithms**: A collection of functions to be used with STL containers. They are built to work with iterators and provide a range of functionality from searching and sorting to modifying sequences. Examples include `sort`, `find`, `accumulate`, `count`, `copy`, and `for_each`.

3. **Iterators**: Objects that point to elements within the containers. They are used to traverse the elements of a container. Iterators are broadly categorized as:
    - Input Iterators
    - Output Iterators
    - Forward Iterators
    - Bidirectional Iterators
    - Random Access Iterators

4. **Functors (Function Objects)**: These are classes that define the operator `()` and can thus be used like functions. They are particularly useful for defining algorithms' behavior and passing functionality as parameters.

### Benefits of Using STL

- **Reusability**: Provides a set of well-tested components that can be used across different applications.
- **Efficiency**: Many of the components are optimized for performance.
- **Flexibility**: Templates allow for the creation of generic and reusable code.
